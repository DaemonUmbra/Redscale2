<h1>Alliterative Altercation!</h1>
Every combat you encounter in this game consists of a cycle of phases:
<p>Aggress! This is your chance to harm your opponent. The card you choose will determine how many attacks you make, how accurate each is, and how damaging the blows you land will be. However: your opponent will rarely be defenseless, and instead will hamper you on one or more of those dimensions: deflecting attacks, dodging to reduce your accuracy, or bracing to endure your blows with reduced damage.<br></br>
As the attacker, it benefits you most to use an attack that is high in whatever aspect the enemy is reducing, so that it matters less.<br></br>
Also, pay attention to the size of your stacks. Choosing a larger stack will increase the effectiveness, but typically by doing more of what the attack is already good at. However, it will also cost more stamina. If you spend more stamina than you have, you will be forced to randomly discard cards from both aggress and abjure hands to make up the difference. And if your opponent defends against your attack's weakness, you may get little or no effect through at all.</p>
<p>Abjure! This is your opponent's chance to hurt you. The card you choose will reduce an aspect of your enemy's attack. With a single card, you can negate an attack if you match its weakness. Each additional card adds roughly half the base effectiveness, so a 3-stack can negate some attacks that a one-stack wouldn't, and a 5-stack will pretty much always negate an attack in the starter area. Again, you will use more stamina though, so it may not be worth it.<br></br>
Combat begins with either Aggress or Abjure, depending on whether you hunt your prey or find yourself attacked.</p>
<p>Assess! After both sides have attacked, you take a moment to assess the situation. At this point, your enemy's tell will give a hint of what their next attack and defense will be, and you can choose how to approach the next round. Your choice determines what phases come next and in what order, how many cards you will draw, and even whether to abandon the battle.</p>
<p>Apprehend! If your opponent is hurt badly enough or runs out of stamina, they may surrender, giving you options of how to profit from their defeat. Your rewards depend on the enemy you felled.</p>
<p>Aquire! If you kill your opponent outright, you have a different set of options to take advantage of, such as devouring their dead flesh. You can kill a surrendered enemy, but you can't bring a dead foe back to life.</p>
<p>Gaining cards: When you defeat some enemies, you can gain copies of new combat cards to improve your abilities. The more copies of a card you have, the less likely it is to be successful, and there is a hard limit on each type of card. (Typically 10.) Once you've started to acquire better cards, you can visit your mother's spirit for help Focusing by removing older cards from your deck. When you've removed copies of a card, new copies will be set aside and not added automatically; you can still add them back in by Focusing again.</p>
<p>Healing: Over time, your body converts nutrition into stamina, and stamina into health. You can make this happen by either travelling, or resting. Resting also sets your restore point, which you rewind to whenever you are defeated, so don't go too long without resting at your hoard.</p>
<p>Pawns: Intelligent enemies can be recruited as pawns to help you in combat, and at encampments you set up around the area. Of course, for that you have to take them alive! When you are attacked, for several rounds after the first you will call your pawns in to assist you in battle. A tell will inform you how they are helping this time. They can assist in defense, improve your attack, or even launch an attack of their own. (An enemy that deflects will have to deal with the pawn's attack before your own.)<br></br>
Pawns may not be able to travel everywhere you could, so you may need to leave them at your hoard, or form an encampement to leave them behind.</p>
