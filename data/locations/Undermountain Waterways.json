Indeed the rock walls here are full of cracks and crevices of varying sizes, many with eyes peering out at you as you pass by. Jaws snap out on occassion when one of the smaller fish venture to close, snake-like creatures darting forward to sieze a small meal. The smaller eels aren't much to worry about, but the occasional larger eye keeps your notice.",

You spin your body about in a tight circle, bringing your tail to bare on it with a vicious smash! Ouch! The rock didn't give way, though it did look like it got pushed a bit further between the others.\n\nOkay, a bit more force is called for. You swim back upstream a few dragon-lengths before darting forward, letting the current aid you. With a quick spin at the last moment, you bring all your strength into a vicious smash! That hurt much less, as the stone cracked in two, half of it flying off down the river! The second half follows it quickly, and without a proper wedge the others break off and go tumbling downstream and out of sight as well! A trio of rocks remain, themselves dug tightly into the riverbed, but your passage is quite clear now.\n\nBut where will this dark tunnel lead you?"
